# E-commerce
An e-commerce platform that provides a seamless online shopping experience, featuring user-friendly navigation, secure transactions, and comprehensive product management.

In the dynamic world of e-commerce, data-driven insights are key to staying competitive. Our Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis of the O-List store's performance, offering valuable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
